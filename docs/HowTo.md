# Instructions for Adding a GPT Pilot Project to a New Device

## Prerequisites

- GPT Pilot is installed and set up on both devices.

- Make note of the installation folders on each device.

## On Original Device

- Locate the `gpt-pilot` folder inside the GPT Pilot installation folder.

- Inside is a `pilot` folder, containing the `gpt-pilot` database file. 

- Also locate the workspace folder for the project.

## On Target Device 

- Make sure GPT Pilot extension is not running.

## Copy Files

- Copy the database file and workspace folder to the same locations on the target device.

## Using Project on New Device

- Launch GPT Pilot extension.

- The copied project should now be available.

## Considerations

- Make sure to copy the full database and workspace folder.

- Database path may differ on each device.

- Workspace can be anywhere but should match original structure.
