I have a project with the following folders and files:
```
{{ project_structure }}
```

Here are the descriptions of all files and folders within `{{ folder_path }}`:
```
{% for child in children %}
{% if child['description'] != None -%}
The description for the {{ child['type'] }} {{ child['name'] }} is:
{{ child['description'] }}
{%- endif %}

{% endfor %}
```

Now, tell me a description of what does this folder do in 5 sentences.
