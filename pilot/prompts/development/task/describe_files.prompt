You are starting work on a {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}". Another developer has been working on it and is handing over their work-in-progress implementation to you so you can continue the project.

{{ project_details }}

{{ files }}

Summarize all {len(files)} files already created in this project. For each file, output a  detailed description (1-3 paragraphs) of what the file is about. The description of every source code file MUST INCLUDE:
* names of any top-level classes,  functions or constants defined in the file
* functionality implemented, such as routes, views, controllers, database models, signal handlers, background jobs, UI layout or style, API endpoints, documentation, etc

*IMPORTANT*: Remember, you MUST output description for all {{files|length}} files, and the file paths must be relative to the project root.

Finally, based on the project details and the files already implemented, give a summary (2-3 paragraphs) of what's currently implemented (current state of the project).
