You are working on a {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}" and you need to write code for the entire {{ task_type }} based on the tasks that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for "{{ name }}" as well.

{{ project_details }}

{% if current_task_index != 0 or task_type == 'feature' %}
So far, this code has been implemented:
{% for file in files %}
**{{ file.path }}/{{ file.name }}**:
```{# file.language #}
{{ file.content }}
```

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

We've broken the development of this {{ task_type }} down to these tasks:
```{% for task in development_tasks %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ task['description'] }}
{% endfor %}
```

You are currently working on task #{{ current_task_index + 1 }} with the following description:
```
{{ development_tasks[current_task_index]['description'] }}
```
{% if current_task_index != 0 %}All previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.{% endif %}
Summarize all {len(files)} files already created in this project. For each file, output a  detailed description (1-3 paragraphs) of what it is about. The description of every source code file MUST INCLUDE:
* names of any top-level classes,  functions or constants defined in the file
* functionality implemented, such as routes, views, controllers, database models, signal handlers, background jobs, UI layout or style, API endpoints, documentation, etc

*IMPORTANT*: Remember, you MUST output description for all 65 files,  and the file paths must be relative to the project root.
